## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up Kotfolio locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kotfolio.git
   ```

2. **Getting Started**

    First, run the development server by typing the following command in a terminal under the `site` folder:

    ```bash
    $ cd site
    $ kobweb run
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

You can use any editor you want for the project, but we recommend using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** downloaded
using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

Press `Q` in the terminal to gracefully stop the server.
